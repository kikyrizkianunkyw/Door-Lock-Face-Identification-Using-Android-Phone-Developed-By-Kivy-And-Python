Hello
This File is just an example if you are doing with the same project this could be a reference to you
The purpose of this project is i want to make an open and lock door using face identification with the tools of android phone. so yes i make an apllication build in python and for the GUI i am using Kivy to support the python language.
And to after you finish make the code for application next you have to build the code so it could be a real and useful application. To pursue it you have to doing some spesific things to make android aplication using python lang by using Buildozer Tools . 
About Buildozer you can watch on the youtube how to build your python application. And for my project i am using Linux OS for buildozer. 
For more information just ask me , Thank You.
